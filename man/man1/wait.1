.th WAIT I 4/9/73
.sh NAME
wait \*- await completion of process
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd wait
.sh DESCRIPTION
Wait until all processes started with
.bd &amp;
have completed,
and report on abnormal terminations.
.s3
Because
.it &quot;sys wait&quot;
must be executed in the parent process,
the Shell itself executes
.it wait,
without creating a new process.
.sh &quot;SEE ALSO&quot;
sh (I)
.sh BUGS
After executing
.it wait
you are committed to waiting until
termination,
because interrupts and quits are ignored
by all processes concerned.
The only out, if the process does not terminate,
is to
.it kill
it from another terminal or to
hang up.
